## Docker

```shell
docker run -p 9212:9212 macropower/wakatime-exporter:0.0.3 --wakatime.api-key="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Time zones

Wakatime will use whatever timezone you have set in your preferences to choose what date to append new metrics to. For instance, a timezone of America/New_York results in the local date changing at 4AM UTC. This exporter, by default, will begin to query the next date at 12AM UTC. This will lead to innacuracies in the data, as the final hours (4 hours, in this case) will not be reported.

**Thus, you must take _one_ of the following two actions to recieve correct data:**
- Set the `--wakatime.t-offset` parameter to adjust when the exporter begins querying the new date. For instance, since America/New_York is UTCâˆ’04:00, you can supply `-4h` to obtain correct results. This parameter accepts both positive and negative values.
- Change your timezone in your Wakatime preferences to `UTC` at: https://wakatime.com/settings/preferences
